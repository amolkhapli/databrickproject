## 🥉🥈🥇 Medallion Architecture

### Bronze Layer (Raw)
- Stores raw, immutable transaction events
- Acts as the **system of record**
- Enables replay without re-ingesting Kafka data

### Silver Layer (Cleaned)
- Applies data quality rules
- Deduplicates transactions
- Handles late-arriving data using watermarks
- Produces trusted, analytics-ready data

### Gold Layer (Consumption)
Split into **two independent layers** to avoid performance and governance conflicts.
